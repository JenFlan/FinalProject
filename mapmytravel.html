			<p>A simple form would appear like on Tripline.net or Travellerspoint.com where a person could pick from a drop down of locations, or ideally from their saved list of partners that would also populate a new stop on the map and itinerary. If it's possible, it would be great if details about the partner could be stored and thus populate the notes, destination etc fields. Fields exist on Trip line and Travellerspoint, but they aren't what is needed, thus how do I build this form that can be populated manually, or autopopulated from a CSV file or equivalent to create a database?</p>
